# Whatsapp_Desktop_bot
A simple Python bot to send messages from Whatsapp Desktop.

This bot was designt to be started from an Excel sheet to send a picture of a table/graph to several whatsapp groups.
The Excel macro should copy the table/graph and then start the bot.
The bot should open the Whatsapp desktop application, serch for the group, past the image, add a text to it and send. Then it should loop to all other groups.
